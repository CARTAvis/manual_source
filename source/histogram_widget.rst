Histogram widget
================

The Histogram Widget allows you to visualize image data as a histogram. The "**Image**" dropdown menu and the "**Region**" dropdown menu can select which region from which image to display. When the selected image has the polarization axis, you can use the "**Polarization**" dropdown menu to select a target polarization component to compute a histogram. The default is "Active", which means the active (selected) region and the active image in the Image Viewer. The “Active” option refers to the entire image if no region is active. Multiple Histogram Widgets can be created to display histograms computed with a combination of "**Image**", "**Region**", and "**Polarization**" (if it is available).

The histogram plot can be zoomed and panned with a mouse, similar to the Spatial Profiler Widget or the Spectral Profiler Widget (:ref:`mouse_interaction_with_charts`).

Additional options to customize the histogram plot are provided in the settings dialog which can be launched by clicking the "**cog**" icon at the top-right corner. In the "**Configuration**" tab, you can apply a custom range and the number of bins to compuate the histogram. 

With the toolbar at the bottom-left of the histogram width, you can export the plot as a PNG file or as a TSV text file.

.. note::
   Histogram fitting functions will be added in a future release.
