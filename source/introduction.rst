Introduction
============

CARTA development scope
-----------------------
CARTA, *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, is an image visualization and analysis tool designed for the ALMA, the VLA, and the SKA pathfinders - MeerKAT and ASKAP as well as the SKA as it evolves. CARTA is designed to be a modern, web-based, and high-performance image viewer for large astronomical data cubes, which are often in the range of gigabytes to multi-terabytes in size. As the image size increases dramatically with modern telescopes in the past decade or so, viewing an image with a local CPU-based image viewer or with a remote CPU-based image viewer via the SSH protocol plus X11 tunneling or the VNC becomes much less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability, scalability, and maintainability for the future by focusing on UI/UX and utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization. For example, to enhance the science productivity for astronomers, CARTA has been integrated with the ALMA, NRAO, and ASKAP (CASDA) science archives, allowing users to visualize images from these archives directly. In addition, CARTA is now featured as one of the tools in an SRCNet prototyping team, having been chosen to visualize SKA astronomical data.



Client-Server architecture
--------------------------
CARTA uses a client-server architecture suitable for visualizing images with large file sizes (GB to several TB) easily obtained from ALMA, VLA, or SKA pathfinders (MeerKAT and ASKAP) observations. Processing such a massive file with a personal computer or a laptop is difficult. Using a client-server architecture, heavy-lifting computation and data storage can be handled by remote enterprise-class servers or clusters with high computing power and high-performance storage. At the same time, processed products are sent to clients for light-weight computation and for visualization with modern web technologies, such as GPU-accelerated rendering. This architecture also enables users to visualize images from the ALMA, NRAO, and ASKAP (CASDA) science archives directly using CARTA as an interface.

Codebase and releases
---------------------
CARTA is an open-source project. Its source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CARTAvis. 

CARTA has two deployment modes: "Site Deployment Mode" (SDM) and "User Deployment Mode" (UDM). The former is designed for hosting multiple users on an enterprise-class server, while the latter is designed for single-user usage on a personal computer, laptop, or remote server. 

Installation guides for the "Site Deployment Mode" and the "User Deployment Mode" are provided in the section :ref:`installation_configuration`. Please contact the `CARTA Helpdesk <support@carta.freshdesk.com>`_ (support@carta.freshdesk.com) or file an `issue <https://github.com/CARTAvis/carta/issues>`_ if there is a problem. 

Besides the annual stable release (the current stable release is v5.0.0), there are one or two beta releases within the one-year development cycle. With the beta releases, you can try new features and provide feedback to the development team to improve the next stable release. Please visit the CARTA homepage (https://cartavis.org) for the latest beta and stable releases.
