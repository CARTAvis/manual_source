Introduction
============

CARTA development scope
-----------------------
CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the ALMA, the VLA, and the SKA pathfinders - MeerKAT and ASKAP as well as the SKA as it evolves. Currently, CARTA is featured as one of the tools in an SRCNet prototyping team, having been chosen to visualize SKA astronomical data. As the image size increases dramatically with modern telescopes in recent years, viewing an image with a local CPU-based image viewer or with a remote CPU-based image viewer via the SSH protocol plus X11 tunneling or the VNC becomes much less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization. 

Client-Server architecture
--------------------------
CARTA uses a client-server architecture suitable for visualizing images with large file sizes (GB to TB) easily obtained from ALMA, VLA, or SKA pathfinders (MeerKAT and ASKAP) observations. Processing such a massive file with a personal computer or a laptop is difficult. Using a client-server architecture, computation and data storage can be handled by remote enterprise-class servers or clusters with high computing power and high-performance storage. At the same time, processed products are sent to clients only for visualization with modern web technologies, such as GPU-accelerated rendering. This architecture also enables users to visualize images from the ALMA and the VLA science archives using CARTA as an interface.

Codebase and releases
---------------------
CARTA is an open-source project. Its source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CARTAvis. 

CARTA has two deployment modes: "Site Deployment Mode" (SDM) and "User Deployment Mode" (UDM). The former is designed for hosting multiple users on an enterprise-class server, while the latter is designed for single-user usage on a personal computer, laptop, or remote server. 

Installation guides for the "Site Deployment Mode" and the "User Deployment Mode" are provided in the section :ref:`installation_configuration`. Please contact the `CARTA Helpdesk <support@carta.freshdesk.com>`_ (support@carta.freshdesk.com) if there is a problem. 

Besides the annual stable release (the current stable release is v4.1.0), there are one or two beta releases within the one-year development cycle. With the beta releases, you can try new features and provide feedback to the development team to improve the next stable release. Please visit the CARTA homepage (https://cartavis.org) for the latest beta and stable releases.
