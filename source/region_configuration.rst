Distance Measurement Tool
-------------------------
The distance measurement tool is available from the toolbar of the Image Viewer or the dialog bar at the top of the GUI. To measure a geodesic distance on an image, you can use two mouse clicks to define a starting point and a finishing point, respectively, for the distance calculations. Alternatively, you can use the Distance Measurement Dialog to enter a pair of coordinates for the same purpose. 

The result is visualized on the image, including the iso-longitude and iso-latitude geodesic lines. The appearance of the rendered geodesic lines can be customized in the "**Styling**" tab of the Distance Measurement Dialog. 

You can have new measurements with pairs of clicks. Click the "**pan**" button in the toolbar to leave the state. A distance in pixel values will be provided if the geodesic distance cannot be calculated.
