Log widget
==========
The Log Widget is a tool which provides important diagnostic information when something has gone wrong. It offers multiple log levels for reporting different levels of detail:
        
* Debug: intended for in-depth analysis and troubleshooting.
* Info (default): presents general information and updates.
* Warning: highlights potential issues or concerns.
* Error: indicates encountered errors that require attention.
* Critical: identifies critical errors demanding immediate intervention.
